						<p class="card-text">The final (2nd) installment of my 2-part drum and bass mix series inspired by creamy desserts.  In this mix, I took the vibe from the first installment, "Creme Frishe" and hit it with an artisian-grade blowtorch to give it a "crispy" top "layer". Its quite a bit funkier, rolling-ier, and crispier than the first installment, hence the name :).</p>

It was long thought that this mix was lost forever...until recently when it showed up on an old laptop as an audio CD ISO.  It has been ripped and converted for your listening pleasure and currently holds a coveted spot in heavy rotation.</p>

  			<div class="card-body" style="padding: 1.25rem;">
  				<p>Snack (aka Chris O) started clubbing in the summer of 1993 at the age of 17 and quickly developed a passion for underground EDM. In 1994 he sold his guitar and bought his 1st pair of Technics. Snack moved to the UK to "study abroad" in the fall of 1997 with the intention of bringing the then fledgling drum and bass sound back to the States with him.  Instead he found himself caught up in the raw energy of hard dance/UK hard house and promptly shifted focus.</p>
				<p>Upon his return to the states in spring 1998, Snack fully immersed himself in the scene as partner in one of NC's most successful production companies, Sonic Boom. The Sonic Boom parties of 1998-2001 helped affirm his reputation as one of the region's leading underground EDM DJs and gave him a suitable outlet to refine his technical skills. His involvement with the local record store Wax Worx led to an opportunity to host a Thursday night residency at Legend's in Raleigh for over a year with his partners in crime.</p>
  				<p>During 2000 and while still a student at North Carolina State University, he enjoyed a tenure at one of the country's leading college radio stations, WKNC 88.1FM. He held the position as Sales Director and served as a DJ for the popular "Afterhours" electronic music program.</p>
  				<p>In summer 2001, Snack co-produced and engineered a remix of James Fusion’s "Shock Drum" for 12" vinyl on Milk Recordings. For many years, Snack worked closely with Milk Recordings' Billie Blaze and Primal Instinct's James Fusion to promote the sound of upfront, banging techno/NRG in the U.S.</p>
  				<p>In his nearly 30-year career, Snack has had the honor of opening for or playing alongside world-reknown artists such as Jon The Dentist, Hipp-E, The Dever, Halo, James Fusion, Karl K, Pish Posh, Soulslinger, Doc Scott, Pete Moss, DJ Who, Dara, Samm-E, Charles Feelgood, Scott Henry, Terry Mullen, J-Majik, Angel Alanis, Odi, Danny Da Wildchild, Bad Boy Bill, Richard Humpty Vision, CZR, Dread, Dieselboy, and Phantom 45.  He has had the fortune of playing with countless other local and regional favorites and to perform just about everywhere in NC, TN and VA.</p>
  				<p>Through the mid to late 2000's Snack's activities included promotion, DJ'ing, artist management, and production efforts. As a Gruv Glu, Diffuse Audio, and Deli Fresh DJ, Snack organized, promoted and otherwise facilitated larger semi-monthly events in the area and worked behind the scenes to keep EDM alive in North Carolina. As a DJ, he continued to hone his skills.  When not directly performing, Snack often functioned as a liaison, conflict resolution specialist, social lubricant, and scene shrink.</p>
  				<p>After starting a family in early 2014, Snack took a break from the scene to focus on his family and career.  With the COVID lockdown in 2020, Snack got ants in his pants and decided to re-emerge, this time with a focus on drum and bass...the genre that originally inspired him.  These days Snack plays a wide variety of dnb styles but tends to prefer sounds that are influenced by his love for techno.</p>
